**NOTICE! Message from @philostler regarding the future of `rspec-sidekiq`...**
> Hi all,
>
> I first wrote this library one quiet night in the space of about 4 hours, the result of the frustration of not being able to find a neat way of testing Sidekiq queues and workers.
>
> I'm hugely happy that since then, this library has proved useful to many others and that many have contributed back to the project. Thank you to everyone that opened a PR. Your additionals have been gladly received.
>
> I am no longer a Ruby developer however, and I have long since moved to the world of JavaScript. While I have still been accepting PRs for `rspec-sidekiq`, I have increasingly been unable to gauge thier quality and usefulness due to my distance from Sidekiq and Ruby itself.
>
> I am therefore looking for a NEW MAINTAINER(S) for this project who can pickup where I cannot. If you're interested, please drop me an email on my GH email address.
>
> In the meantime, I will continue merging PRs that seem useful and have tests, and releasing when prompted.
>
> Phil
